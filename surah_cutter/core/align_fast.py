"""Fast two-phase forced alignment — pause onsets + growing neural windows.

The accurate path (:func:`surah_cutter.core.align.align_surah`) runs the acoustic
model over the **whole** sura. This module saves inference time by running the
model only over **short windows**, sized up on demand. The boundary is still
placed by the neural aligner (not by a pause), so accuracy is preserved.

Two explicit phases (the UI exposes both so the user can steer them):

**Phase 1 — rough pass by pauses (cheap, no neural).**
Silero VAD gives silence segments. For each ayah boundary we take the *onset of
the wave* after the pause (``pause.end_ms``, where speech resumes) — NOT the
quiet centre — matched to the ayah's expected position (structural prior). Ayahs
with no nearby pause are *wasl* (joined) — their rough guess comes from the prior
plus the running tempo.

**Phase 2 — neural refinement with a growing window (from 1 s).**
For each boundary we read a **1-second** window around its rough position, run
the model on that slice only, forced-align the local words, and take the start of
the ayah's first word. If the alignment is confident and the onset sits
comfortably inside the window → keep it. If not → grow the window by 1 second and
re-read, up to ``max_win_s``. Most boundaries resolve at 1-2 s, so the total
audio fed to the model is far less than one full pass → genuinely faster.

No cascade: each ayah is anchored by *its own* pause, so one bad onset does not
poison the next. The only cross-ayah coupling is a final monotonic clamp.

Returns the same shape as :func:`align.align_surah`: ``[(ayah, start_ms, conf)]``.

    Global DP, but the match cost is **bias-free / relative**: a boundary's
    predicted position is the *previously matched pause* plus the prior's
    *expected gap* (``exp[i] - exp[i']``), not the prior's absolute position.
    This is the key robustness fix — the structural prior is reliable about the
    relative spacing of ayahs but biased in absolute time (it ignores melodic
    tempo drift and the basmala), so anchoring each step on a real onset removes
    the bias while keeping global optimality (unlike a per-step cascade).

    A **duration floor/ceiling** rejects implausible matches: a matched ayah
    span shorter than ``dur_floor`` × its char-expected duration (an early grab
    of a within-ayah waqf / breath pause) or longer than ``dur_ceil`` × (a far
    jump past the real pause) is forbidden. Melodic recitation only *lengthens*
    ayahs versus the char estimate, so a low floor is safe and is what stops the
    off-by-one runs. ``anchor`` is the neural content start (ayah-1 onset), used
    as the floor reference for the first matched boundary.

    Each boundary is matched, left *wasl* (cost ``wasl_pen``), or skips an onset
    as an extra pause (cost ``extra_pen``). Skips are bounded to ``max_skip``
    consecutive. Returns, per boundary, the matched onset (ms) or ``None``.
